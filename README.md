# Third-eye-cpp
#Purpose
Will create 65536 permutation of 2 bytes in bits, then creates another text file that will only show manchester valid bytes
#machesterFile.txt
holds all the manchester information
#byteFile
65536 permuations
#optimization
Obviously could be significantly improved when writing to two different files, big problem is the iteration of the bytes array 2x.  fix would be simple but considering how the biggest problem is the time creation idgaf.
